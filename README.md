## Description

This portfolio is the beginning of a repository created to hold my future coding projects so that potential employers my look at it and see the work I have done. This is the second homework challenge for the NorthWestern Full-stack coding bootcamp. 

## Usage

I use this portfolio as a repository of my completed work, and also for people to be able to look me up and see what projects I have done to understand my coding ability.
